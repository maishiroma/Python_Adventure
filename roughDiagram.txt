This will be the 1st draft of the text adventure game that I'll make specifically in Python.

GOAL: To see if I can make a game in Python using what I know and can do. 

Game: This will be a reimagination of the text adventure that I made back in USC summer class except this time I'll be using just a text editor and Terminal instead of a IDE.
