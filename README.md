# Python Remastered Adventure
This contains the source code for one of the exercises that I was working on online.
- GOAL: To see if I can make a game in Python using what I know and can do. 

- Game: This will be a reimagination of the text adventure that I made back in USC summer class except this time I'll be using just a text editor and Terminal instead of a IDE.
